This project serves as an introduction to my advanced HTML skills acquired as a software engineering student at ALX Africa. Through this, my inaugural complex HTML project, I demonstrate my mastery of critical HTML concepts beyond the basics. The dynamic, aesthetically designed website exemplifies my proficiency in semantic HTML tags, HTML forms, embedding multimedia, and building responsive pages that adapt across devices. I leverage these advanced techniques to construct an interactive, multi-media rich web page that looks professional across screens. Overall, this project highlights my HTML skills progression from foundation to advanced application by putting my expanded knowledge into practice.
